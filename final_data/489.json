The top of the banner displays a prominent heading (`heading`) in bold white, followed by a slightly smaller subheading (`subheading`) in light cyan. The product price (`price`) is enclosed in a bold blue circle, making it visually striking. Technical highlights (`description`) are aligned at the bottom in a streamlined row.

The primary color used is a soft cream beige (#F1EEE7), offering a neutral, calming aesthetic. Subtle shadows and highlights provide gentle gradients, with light gray tones (#D9D6CE) for depth and contours, and near-white accents (#FAF9F5) for clean shine along the edges. The modest use of soft shadowing helps blend the colors while still accentuating the form and texture. A sophisticated palette for an advertisement banner would include: #F1EEE7, #D9D6CE, #FAF9F5, and a muted metallic accent like #C2C0B9.  \n"}
