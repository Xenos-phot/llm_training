Below that, the \"description\" text block explains the product's key qualities. A bold \"price\" text is followed by a rectangular \"cta_button\" with \u201ccta\u201d text prompting user action. Beneath, a smaller \"features\" block highlights comfort details. On the right, the \"product_image\" displays a light-colored sneaker with brown accents, balanced by abstract graphical blocks in the background for visual interest.\n\n**Color Palette:**\n- Brown: `#8B6E4E` (Background and text)\n- Beige: `#F5F1E8` (Primary background)\n- Light Cream: `#DDD3BF` (Heading, CTAs, shapes)\n- Accent Brown: `#A38768` (Borders, graphical elements)\n- White: `#FFFFFF` (Text and product contrast)\n\n",
    "product_color": "  \nThe product image highlights a pair of sneakers with a clean and earthy aesthetic. The dominant color is a soft **cream beige (#F5F0E6)** seen across the canvas upper, providing a neutral and sophisticated base. Accenting this are **chocolate brown (#5C3A28)** tones on the laces, sole edges, eyelets, and outline of the star logo, adding rich contrast and warmth. The sole and midsole feature a **light taupe (#D9CDBF)** which complements the cream base, while a **pure white (#FFFFFF)** star icon adds a crisp highlight that draws attention. These tones are well-blended for a vintage look, ideal for a minimal yet stylish advertisement banner.  \n"
