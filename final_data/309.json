The background features soft abstract gradients and translucent circular shapes that add subtle depth without distracting from the main content. The heading layer (`heading`) is bold and dark blue, while the subheading (`subheading`) uses a vibrant blue to emphasize premium quality. The feature list (`description`) neatly summarizes the device\u2019s key specs in a compact format. The price tag (`price`) stands out in a bold, oversized font, complemented by a call-to-action button (`cta_button`) with a matching blue fill and white text (`cta`). The banner also includes a prominently positioned product image (`product_image`) that overlaps neatly with the text for visual balance.\n\n**Color Palette:**\n- Background Base: #F2F2F7  \n- Accent Gray: #E2E2E7  \n- Primary Text: #1B1D52  \n- Secondary Blue: #4B5EFC  \n- Price Text: #1B1D52  \n- Button Fill: #4B5EFC  \n- Button Text: #FFFFFF  \n- Description Text: #333333\n", "product_color": "  \nThe product image showcases a sleek and minimalistic Samsung smartphone in a smooth silver-white finish. The dominant color palette consists of soft silver (#D9D9D9), classic white (#FFFFFF), deep black (#000000), and subtle champagne gold-yellow accents (#F5E996) within the screen\u2019s abstract background. The neutral silver body blends elegantly with the display's muted tones, giving a premium and futuristic feel. The pre-highlighted sparkles and soft gradients transition smoothly between light gray (#BFBFBF) and yellow, creating a subtle glow. For an advertisement banner, combining these colors with high-contrast black text or icons can enhance product clarity while maintaining a luxurious aesthetic.  \n"}
