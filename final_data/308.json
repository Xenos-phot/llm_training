The feature list (**description**) is succinct and bullet-pointed in a dark gray font, neatly placed to the left of the central focus - a high-resolution product image (**product_image**) floating on soft, curved abstract background shapes. The price (**price**) stands out in bold type, placed at the bottom left. A prominent call-to-action button with a vivid orange background and white text (**cta_background** and **cta**) encourages conversion.

The base is a soft beige/off-white (#E6E2D2), providing a neutral backdrop. Bold black (#1C1C1C) is used for the iconic Adidas stripes, creating strong contrast and brand recognition. Vibrant gradients of orange (#FF5A1F), red-orange (#FF3C38), and yellow (#FFD447) energize the design along the midsole and heel, symbolizing speed and motion. A splash of salmon coral (#FF6F61) accents the lace-line, enhancing visual flow. Colors are blended through smooth transitions, especially in the heel area, making them vivid yet harmonious. This palette is ideal for a striking, energetic advertisement banner.\n"}
