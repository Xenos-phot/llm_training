Subtle metallic elements like the small gold control knob (#C9A54A) offer a sharp contrast, drawing the eye to functional design points. The Marshall logo in crisp white (#FFFFFF) pops against the black grill, emphasizing brand identity. This monochromatic palette is cohesive yet dynamic, ideal for a minimalist advertisement banner with modern elegance.\n"
