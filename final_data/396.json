At the top, a sleek brand name is displayed using the `heading` text object in a futuristic sans-serif font. Directly beneath it, the `subheading` emphasizes the product name with bold, uppercase styling. The `description` text section lists four main product features in a clear, left-aligned layout.\n\nThe product image (`product_image`) is placed prominently on the lower right, drawing key focus. On the bottom left, the `price` text object highlights affordability strongly. A soft rectangular `cta_background` button with centered `cta` text invites the user to take action.\n\n**Color Palette:**\n- Warm Off-White (#F4F0E8)\n- Soft Taupe (#C8BFB5)\n- Muted Mocha (#7A6D5D)\n- Beige Gray (#A59988)\n- Deep Brown (#5D534A)\n- White (#FFFFFF)\n\n",
    "product_color": "\nThe product image showcases a pair of sleek over-ear headphones in a minimalist, warm beige color palette. The design uses subtle gradients of cream and off-white, giving it a refined and cohesive look. The main body is a soft ivory tone (#F6F1E7), while the shadows and curves blend into light taupe (#E0D8CE) and beige-neutral highlights (#FAF6F0). These tones are well-blended but slightly contrasted to emphasize depth, texture, and contour. For an advertisement banner, complementing colors such as soft gold (#D1BFA3) and matte charcoal (#3A3A3A) can add elegance and readability while preserving the modern aesthetic of the product.\n"
