The background consists of a soft, diagonal dual-tone gradient with abstract radial circles and curve overlays, adding depth and vibrance. A high-quality image of the product dominates the right half, strategically balancing the visual weight. The left side hosts multiple text layers: large, bold title layers (`heading_1`, `heading_2`) introduce the product name; a smaller, clean subtitle (`subheading`) defines its category; a detailed bullet list (`description`) outlines key features. The promotional price (`price`) is bold and prominent, accompanied by a purple call-to-action button (`cta_background`, `cta`) with white text. \n\n**Color Palette:**\n- Gradient Background: #C3B1E1, #9370DB\n- Accent Elements: #E6E6FA, #D8BFD8\n- Text: #FFFFFF, #FFF5F5\n- CTA Button: #5D3FD3\n",
    "product_color": "\nThe product image showcases a pair of sleek, over-ear headphones in various shades of lavender and purple, giving it a modern and luxurious feel. The primary color is a soft lavender (#C8A2C8), used on the ear cups and headband. Deeper purples such as #7E5A9B appear on the mesh padding and interior, adding richness and depth. Light violet highlights (#E6DAF0) give a glossy sheen, enhancing contrast and dimension. Subtle gradients blend these tones smoothly, while metallic reflections highlight the contours. For advertisement banners, combining these aesthetics with complementary silver (#D3D3D3) or pastel backgrounds will enhance brand elegance and contemporary appeal.\n"
