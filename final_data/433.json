The earcups showcase a smooth transition between icy blue (#A3BCCF) and metallic silver-blue (#7B99B1), creating a sophisticated yet minimalist contrast. The metallic finishes subtly capture light, adding depth and dimension. This clean combination of colors can evoke premium quality, serenity, and advanced technology in a banner design.\n"}
