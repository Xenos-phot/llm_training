The background uses layered blue circular gradients and soft wave shapes creating a subtle depth, complimented by abstract circular accents for a futuristic touch. The title text (`heading`) is bold and prominent at the top, with a subheading (`subheading`) below it in a smaller size to emphasize product type. Toward the center, there is a visually dominant product image (`product_image`). A bold price tag (`price`) sits underneath, paired with a call-to-action button composed of a rectangle (`cta_background`) and overlaid text (`cta`). A small AppleCare+ badge appears over the product for value emphasis.\n\n**Color Palette:**\n- Sky Blue: `#E6F0F5`\n- Light Blue: `#D6E6F0`, `#C6DCE9`, `#B5D1E3`\n- Deep Sea Blue: `#1E3A5F`\n- Navy Blue: `#2D5A87`\n- Accent Blue: `#A3C7DD`, `#92BDD7`, `#83B3D1`, `#74A9CB`, `#6590B5`, `#5686AF`\n- White: `#FFFFFF`\n", "product_color": "  \nThe product image features a sleek, minimalist palette dominated by cool tones.

The mesh cushioning blends shades of **light blue-gray** (#A3B5C5), giving texture and depth without breaking unity. The AppleCare+ logo introduces a striking **Apple red** (#FF3B30), which pops effectively against the neutral tones, drawing attention but remaining harmonious. This strategic use of contrast and blend highlights product elegance while keeping focus on brand identity.  \n"}
