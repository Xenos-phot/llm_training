The left side features a solid dark green rounded-corner rectangle as a backdrop, which houses key information. The right side prominently displays the product image of the headphones, slightly overlaying decorative abstract shapes and semi-transparent circles for added depth.\n\nAt the top-left, the main callout text (`heading`) uses a futuristic square font in white, arranged in a stacked layout to emphasize the product's premium appeal. Below that, the secondary text (`subheading`) is styled in a soft green hue, introducing the product line.\n\nThe features list (`description`) uses bullet points in a clean sans-serif font, keeping the key selling points readable and direct. Below this, the price (`price`) is clearly displayed in large, bold characters, also in white.\n\nA muted green CTA button (`cta_button`), labeled with inviting dark green text (`cta`), encourages interaction with subtle rounded corners and centralized alignment.\n\nDecorative SVG curves and floating circles in muted beige and light green tones add softness and visual interest to the left section without overwhelming the content.\n\n**Color Palette:**\n- Dark Teal Green: `#2E5754`\n- Soft Mint Green: `#A5C6B1`\n- Off-White Background: `#F5F5F0`\n- White Text: `#FFFFFF`\n",
    "product_color": "  \nThe product image showcases a sleek, matte forest green over-ear headphone that exudes modern minimalism. The primary color is a consistent deep forest green (#3B5A52), used across all elements, including ear cups, headband, and cushioning, creating a seamless and premium tone. Subtle shading enhances contours, using slightly darker tones for depth (#334C46) and softer highlights for definition (#4F726A). Texture variations, such as the mesh inner band and leather padding, add visual interest while maintaining a monochromatic theme. An ideal advertisement banner can use complementary accents like soft beige (#DAD5C3) and charcoal gray (#2F3B37) to make the product stand out while preserving its sophisticated appeal.  \n"
