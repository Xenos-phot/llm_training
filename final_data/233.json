On the left, the brand and product name (`heading_1` and `heading_2`) are prominently displayed in bold, uppercase fonts. Just below them sits a compact tag line (`subheading`) in a sleek, futuristic style. A product features list (`description`) is neatly formatted with bullet points, followed by the price (`price`) in extra-large typography. The call-to-action button, composed of a rectangle (`cta_background`) and overlaying text (`cta`), appears just below. The right half showcases the product image (`product_image`) on a clean, structured background.  \n\n**Color Palette:**  \n- Deep Navy: `#1E3D59`  \n- Steel Blue: `#2B5278`  \n- Light Gray: `#C0C0C0`  \n- White: `#FFFFFF`  \n- Accent Blue (for CTA text): `#1E3D59`  \n",
    "product_color": "  \nThe product image features premium black Marshall headphones with a sleek, textured finish. The dominant color is matte black (#1C1C1C), used for the headband, ear cups, and frame, imparting a bold and sophisticated look. The textured panel on the ear cup has a slightly lighter black shade (#2A2A2A), adding depth and contrast. The brand logo appears in crisp white (#FFFFFF), standing out clearly against the black background for visibility. A metallic gold accent (#D4AF37) on the side control knob adds a touch of luxury. The colors blend seamlessly through subtle contrasts, while maintaining distinct highlights for emphasis and brand identity.  \n"
