    "product_color": "  \nThe product image showcases a sleek, modern wristwatch dominated by a refined monochromatic black-to-gray gradient. The primary color is a deep gunmetal black (#1C1C1C), strongly used on the metallic band and the case. Complementing this is a gradient slate gray dial (#3A3A3A to #707070), which subtly highlights the chronograph sub-dials (#B0B0B0) using radial brushing. The metallic sheen across surfaces creates a reflective quality, blending light and shadow to emphasize depth and sophistication. For an advertisement banner, use a palette of #1C1C1C (Gunmetal Black), #3A3A3A (Slate Gray), #707070 (Steel Gray), and #B0B0B0 (Silver Gray) for a luxurious and elegant visual appeal.  \n"
