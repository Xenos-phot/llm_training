After each wash cycle finishes, a Dry mode provides an extra 60 minutes of drying and offers 72-hour ventilated storage to prevent odors and keep your dishes clean. UP TO 18-HOUR DELAYED START: HAVA Portable Dishwasher can finish the wash program according to your schedule. A delay of up to 18 hours is available with this new model, so you can be assured of having clean dishes at the desired time. You may also use this feature to run the machine during a non-peak time for a lower electricity bill. SELF-CLEAN & CHILD LOCK FUNCTION: The HAVA Mini Dishwasher features a Self-Clean program for thorough cleaning from the inside out, ensuring consistent washing performance. It also includes a child lock function to prevent misoperation.
