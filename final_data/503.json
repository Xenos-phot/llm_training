    "product_color": "  \nThe product image showcases a sleek pair of headphones designed in an elegant monochromatic lavender-purple palette. The primary color is a soft, glossy lavender (#D2B7F0), which dominates the ear cups with a shiny, metallic finish. The inner mesh cushion contrasts subtly using a deeper eggplant purple (#5E4B8B) while the headband and outer casing blend both matte and satin variants of purple-gray (#A397C6, #C6B2E0). This strategic color blending highlights both texture and form, giving the headphones a premium aesthetic. For an advertisement banner, a complementary palette of lavender shades with accents of silver (#E0D7F5) and muted violet (#8C7CB1) will emphasize elegance and tech appeal.  \n"
