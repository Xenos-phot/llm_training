The headline (id: \"heading\") is large and highly visible, presented in a clean sans-serif uppercase font, centered toward the top. Just below is a smaller subheading (id: \"subheading\") describing the product category. A line of key features (id: \"description\") runs horizontally across the lower mid-section. The price (id: \"price\") stands out brightly, followed by a distinct call-to-action button comprised of a rectangular shape (id: \"cta_background\") and its text (id: \"cta\"). The careful layout, contrast, and minimalist icons enhance the modern aesthetic, ideal for advertising premium athletic footwear.\n\n**Color Palette:**\n- Jet Black: #000000  \n- Charcoal Gray: #202020  \n- Light Gray: #CCCCCC  \n- White: #FFFFFF  \n", "product_color": "\nThe product image showcases a pair of fashion-forward athletic shoes, predominantly in a deep matte black (#000000) which exudes a bold, sleek aesthetic.

White (#FFFFFF) text on the straps adds a sharp highlight that enhances visibility and brand presence. The black dominates the structure and form, while the gray and white subtly blend in to provide modern, minimalistic detailing. Together, they create a balanced palette perfect for an energetic and edgy advertisement banner.\n"}
