The primary color is a soft Matte Pearl White (#EDEAE6), which dominates the overall design and conveys luxury and sophistication. Subtle accents of Light Grey (#D6D4D2) are found around the ear cup edges, while a gentle Chrome Silver (#B0B3B8) embellishes the brand logo and detailing. The color transitions are smooth with a satin finish, blending matte and gloss areas to enhance contour and dimension. This gentle contrast subtly highlights the structural curves. For an advertisement banner, a palette of #EDEAE6, #D6D4D2, #B0B3B8, and #FFFFFF would maintain elegance and clarity.  \n"}
