The headband features a darker denim blue (#4C5A66), introducing contrast without overpowering the composition. Metallic accents, such as the silver hinges (#C3C4C7), highlight sophistication and precision. For a vibrant touch, the AppleCare+ badge uses a classic Apple red (#E50000) against a neutral light gray background (#F7F7F7), making it pop prominently while maintaining overall brand elegance.\n"
