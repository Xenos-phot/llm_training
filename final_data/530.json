Supporting feature text (\"description\") lists product strengths in a legible and condensed layout. Pricing is emphasized in large display font (\"price\") and followed by a clear call-to-action button (\"cta\" & \"cta_background\") promoting immediate engagement.\n\n**Color Palette:**\n- Soft Lavender: `#C8C4E3`\n- Muted Mauve: `#9390B5`\n- Deep Plum (Text/CTA): `#3A2D5A`\n- Highlight Purple: `#8F8CB5`\n- Off-white Details: `#FFFFFF`\n\n",
