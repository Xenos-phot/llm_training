The banner has a dark-themed background with layered geometric segments and semi-transparent circles for visual depth. Text layers are strategically placed on the left: the primary headline (`heading`) uses an eye-catching golden hue with a bold typeface, followed by a secondary headline (`subheading`) in large, strong serif font. Below that sits a detailed list of product features (`description`). The price (`price`) is highlighted boldly in gold, just above a bright call-to-action button (`cta_button`) featuring the text (`cta`). The wristwatch image (`product_image`) is prominently featured to the right.\n\n**Color Palette:**\n- Charcoal Black: `#1A1A1A`\n- Rich Gold: `#D4AF37`\n- Soft Gray: `#E0E0E0`\n- Off White: `#F5F5F5`\n- Steel Gray: `#333333`\n",
    "product_color": "\nThe product image showcases a sleek and modern wristwatch with an elegant monochromatic theme. The dominant color palette revolves around various shades of black and gray, creating a high-end, minimalistic aesthetic. Key colors include jet black (#0C0C0C), graphite gray (#2C2C2C), metallic silver (#B3B3B3), and a subtle gradient charcoal (#1F1F1F). The watch dial seamlessly blends matte and glossy textures to highlight the contours and features without overwhelming visual elements. The silver dials and indices subtly reflect light, acting as focal points amidst the darker tones. This refined palette, balanced with contrast, conveys sophistication and durability, ideal for an upscale advertisement banner.\n"
