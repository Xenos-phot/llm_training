The layout is divided diagonally with a dynamic geometric split, where the left side showcases a deep blue gradient background and the right side has a soft greyish-blue tone. The primary focal point is a central product image (\"product_image\") of stylish over-ear headphones angled slightly for a premium effect.\n\nBold typographic elements dominate the left half: two strong heading layers (\"heading_1\" and \"heading_2\") in white, followed by a light-blue \"subheading\" beneath. A decorative line (\"decorative\") separates the textual elements from a four-line feature list (\"description\"). A large, bold price tag (\"price\") is positioned prominently at the bottom left, drawing attention. A rectangular call-to-action button (\"cta_background\") with the text \"cta\" invites user interaction.\n\n**Color Palette:**\n- Deep Royal Blue: #1E3A8A\n- Sky Blue: #60A5FA\n- Light Steel: #CBD5E1\n- Soft Blue Tint: #E2E8F0\n- White: #FFFFFF\n",
    "product_color": "\nThe product image showcases a sleek pair of over-ear Bose headphones in a soft, minimalist color scheme. The primary color is a smooth matte ivory (#EDEAE6), evoking a premium and sophisticated feel. A subtle blend of warm taupe-gray tones (#D6D2CE) is used in the padding and joints, adding depth without disrupting uniformity. Light highlights and soft gradients bring out the contours and texture, particularly through soft whites (#F8F7F6) and light metallic silvers (#C1BFBD), enhancing the refined aesthetic. For an advertisement banner, this color palette provides a modern monochromatic base, ideal for pairing with dark contrasting elements like charcoal (#3A3A3A) or black (#000000) for text and calls to action.\n"
