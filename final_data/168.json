The `price` text element is prominently displayed in large, bold font, guiding attention towards affordability. A `cta_background` rectangle acts as a button behind the `cta` text layer, encouraging user interaction. A realistic `product_image` appears on the right, adding visual appeal. The background features soft gradients and abstract circles from the `background` SVG, contributing to a fresh and health-conscious feel.\n\n**Color Palette:**\n- Teal (#00838F, #0097A7, #00ACC1)\n- Light Aqua (#E0F7FA, #B2EBF2, #80DEEA)\n- White (#FFFFFF)\n- Muted Cyan (#4DD0E1, #26C6DA)\n\n",

Subtle blue indicator lights (#3BAFDA) and a soft red warning icon (#E03C31) add a tech-savvy appeal, highlighting functionality without overpowering the design. These colors are well-balanced, making them ideal for a banner with a serene yet modern visual appeal.\n"
