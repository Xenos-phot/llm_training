The red is subtly blended into the design via textured patterns and fine detailing, maintaining harmony without overpowering the minimalistic white. A hint of metallic gold (#C49A6C) outlining the logo adds a touch of sophistication and premium feel. This color palette \u2013 white, red, and gold \u2013 can be used to design an energetic, high-performance themed advertisement banner.\n"
