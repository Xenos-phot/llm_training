The left half fades from deep navy to sky blue, while the right half continues from sky blue to a soft off-white. Positioned centrally is a high-resolution image of a pair of headphones, partially overlapping both gradient zones to draw attention.\n\nText layer \"heading\" is positioned on the top-left in large bold typography, serving as the main title. Below it is \"tagline\", slightly smaller and colored in a soft periwinkle to emphasize a subheading. The \"features\" text layer lists product highlights in bullet format directly beneath.\n\nAt the lower left, the \"price\" text layer is prominently displayed in bold white for immediate visibility. Below the price, the call-to-action \"cta_button\" contrasts with the background using a soft blue fill and dark blue \"cta_text\" to drive user interaction.\n\nDecorative translucent circles and bars provide graphical finesse and tech-forward ambience to the composition.\n\n**Color Palette:**\n- Deep Navy: #1A365D  \n- Sky Blue: #60A5FA  \n- Off-White: #EDF2F7  \n- Light Periwinkle: #A3BFFA  \n- White: #FFFFFF  \n", "product_color": "\nThe product image features a sleek, modern design with a refined blue color palette. The main earcup surface showcases a smooth metallic sky blue (#8AA9D6), offering a polished and premium appearance. The mesh covering the ear pads is a lighter, cooler blue (#B4CFE9), creating contrast through texture and tone. The headband incorporates a deeper navy blue (#1C3D5A), which adds depth to the overall design. Shiny silver accents (#C0C0C0) at the hinges enhance sophistication and highlight tech precision. These colors are harmoniously blended with gradient shading and subtle reflections, making each component distinct yet cohesive. Ideal banner backgrounds: deep navy, soft gradients, or futuristic metallic tones.\n"}
