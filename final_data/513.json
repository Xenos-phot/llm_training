The background employs a radial gradient with soft pink hues and subtle abstract accents like dashed borders, soft circles, and wave overlays for added visual interest. A centrally placed product image (id: `product_image`) of a pink canvas tote bag is the visual centerpiece.\n\nThe headline (id: `heading`) uses a serif font in bold plum, delivering strong brand messaging, while the subheading (id: `subheading`) complements it with a stylish italic font in a slightly lighter shade. Key product features (id: `description_1`) and supplementary benefits (id: `description_2`) are listed beneath, both in clean, readable fonts.\n\nAt the bottom, a bold price (id: `price`) grabs attention, followed by a strong call-to-action button (id: `cta_button`) with rounded edges and contrasting white text (id: `cta`).\n\n**Color Palette:**\n- Light Pink: `#FFE6EA`\n- Medium Pink: `#FFBEC9`\n- Accent Pink: `#FFB2C0`\n- Deep Plum: `#8C3565`\n- Call-to-Action Pink: `#D13F7A`\n- Text Accent: `#703751`\n- White: `#FFFFFF`\n\n",
    "product_color": "  \nThe product image showcases a pastel pink canvas tote bag, characterized by a soft, warm appearance. The dominant color is a muted baby pink (#F4C6D3), which gives the product a gentle, feminine, and modern appeal. The pink shade is uniformly applied, creating visual harmony while subtly varying in texture due to light and fabric folds. Stitching and pockets introduce shadows in slightly darker pinks (#E9AAB8), offering depth and emphasis. Accents like the metal clasp add contrast in metallic silver (#A9A9A9). For an advertisement banner, combining soft pastel pinks, light greys, and white (#FFFFFF) will evoke a clean and appealing aesthetic.  \n"
