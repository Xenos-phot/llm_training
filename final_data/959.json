A decorative red line separates textual content from the detailed feature list (\"description\"). Pricing information (\"price\") stands out in large white bold font, while a call-to-action (\"cta\") is situated below in a vibrant red button (\"cta_background\"). The design effectively combines structured information with a clean and impactful aesthetic.\n\n**Color Palette:**\n- Charcoal Grey (#333333)\n- Deep Maroon (#6D3535)\n- Light Coral Pink (#E8A9A9)\n- Bright Red (#C13434)\n- White (#FFFFFF)\n",

Dominated by a matte charcoal gray body (#6D6E71), the Crockpot projects a sophisticated, neutral aesthetic. The lid is topped with a muted silver-gray rim (#D4D4D4), complementing the darker tone. The control panel adds contrast with a light beige background (#F2F2F2) and soft gray buttons (#B1B3B5), giving a clean, approachable interface. The blend of dark and light shades ensures functionality is highlighted while preserving an overall cohesive blend. For a banner, consider pairing #6D6E71, #D4D4D4, #F2F2F2, and crisp white (#FFFFFF) with subtle accents.\n"
