The design features a dual-tone angled background with geometric overlays and accents that give it a contemporary feel. The layout is organized with a large product title (`heading`) at the top, followed by a bold subheading (`subheading`) and a descriptive tagline (`tagline`). Below that is a bullet list (`description`) outlining the key product features. A prominent price tag (`price`) at the bottom left is paired with a rectangular call-to-action button (`cta_background`) labeled via `cta`. The right-hand side transitions to a product photo (`product_image`) that visually dominates the lower half, enhancing focus on the item. Background includes lightly opaque decorative elements and diagonal strokes enhancing visual depth.\n\n**Color Palette:**\n- Deep Maroon: `#5D2A23`\n- Dusty Rose: `#8B4B44`\n- Dark Chocolate: `#4A221C`\n- Light Beige: `#E8C39E`\n- Pure White: `#FFFFFF`\n", "product_color": "\nThe product image uses a sleek, modern color palette dominated by neutral tones. The primary color is a matte charcoal gray (#5A5A5A), which covers most of the Crockpot body, giving it a professional and sturdy appearance. This is contrasted by clean white (#FFFFFF) detailing in the lid rim, branding, and control panel, which highlights the functional elements. Subtle beige (#E8E3D9) tones on the control panel add warmth, softening the overall look. Glass elements such as the lid reflect soft muted grays (#D1D2D3), creating natural blending. For an advertisement banner, complementary colors like soft blue (#AFC1D6) or warm amber (#E0A96D) can enhance the palette effectively.\n"}
