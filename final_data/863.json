The design is split into two halves: the left side contains layered text elements, and the right side highlights the product image. The background is composed of deep charcoal and black tones with abstract orange-red and gold graphical accents. Key text elements include a white headline (`heading`), a red promotional tagline (`tagline`), and a clean feature list in white (`description`). Below, a bright orange price tag (`price`) is followed by urgency-driven subtext (`subheading`). The call-to-action button (`cta_background` and `cta`) is bold in red with white text. \n\n**Color Palette:**\n- Charcoal Black: `#1A1A1A`\n- Dark Gray: `#232323`\n- Bright Red: `#FF3B30`\n- Vivid Orange: `#FF9500`\n- White: `#FFFFFF`\n\n",

The lens glass subtly reflects hints of teal green (#6DC1B3), amber yellow (#D6A746), and light grey (#D3D3D3), adding depth and vibrance. White text labels (#FFFFFF) across the dials and body create high contrast, enhancing readability. These colors are blended smoothly, with clean transitions between black tones and reflective highlights, ensuring sharp focus areas. For a banner, using black, white, amber, and teal accents will convey elegance and premium quality.  \n"
