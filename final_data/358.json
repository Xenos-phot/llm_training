            "description": "ABSORBS OIL AND CONTROLS SHINE INSTANTLY\u2014 You never again have to be embarrassed by shiny, oily skin. This formula has silica, which immediately absorbs excess oil and diffuses light, leaving a natural matte finish on your face or bald head. REDUCES ACNE, BLACKHEADS, AND LARGE PORES \u2014 Sweet orange peel extract unclogs skin, leaving pores free of the gunk that causes blackheads and breakouts. Pores shrink to normal size and are less visible. Silica also helps remove toxins. HYDRATES WITHOUT HEAVINESS \u2014 Citronella extract softens and glycerin locks in moisture, leaving skin hydrated without being greasy or heavy. Skin becomes balanced; especially good for combination skin where you have oily and dry patches. An outstanding makeup primer. FREE OF ALL THE BAD STUFF \u2014 The last thing your skin needs is gunk. That\u2019s why Instant Fix Oil Control is free of parabens, phthalates, GMOs, DEA, and triclosan. It\u2019s also allergy and dermatologist tested, and made cruelty free in the USA. FAVORITE WITH GROOMING EXPERTS\u2014 Anthony brand men\u2019s grooming products have been featured (and won awards) in top publications, including Men\u2019s Health, New York Times, Forbes, GQ, and Esquire.
