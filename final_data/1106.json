Not for banners. Not for business.\n\n\ud83d\udeab No understanding of brand tone\n\ud83d\udeab No editable design files\n\ud83d\udeab No banner formats\n\ud83d\udeab No A/B testing\n\ud83d\udeab No translation/localization\n\ud83d\udeab No performance-driven thinking\n\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re shifting from Text-to-Image \u279d Text-to-Graphic.\n\nThese platforms weren\u2019t built for the fast-paced, data-driven world of retail product marketing, where you need thousands of creative assets across different sizes, languages, and target audiences \u2014 all optimized to boost sales \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcb0.\n\nAt Phot.AI, we focus solely on retail products. We help brands and sellers with everything \u2014 from taking product photos \ud83d\udcf8 to cataloging \ud83d\uddc2\ufe0f, to creating ads and marketing materials \ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udce2.\n\nMost tools force you to:\n\u270b Do a lot of manual work\n\ud83d\udccb Use fixed templates\n\ud83d\udd00 Switch between multiple apps\n\nThey give you pretty pictures \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f \u2014 but not powerful marketing graphics that actually drive sales \ud83d\udcb8.\n\nThat\u2019s why we built Phot.AI \u2014 a new design paradigm.\n\nOur text-to-graphic AI platform combines 5 AI agents working together to:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 Create real-looking product photos\n\ud83c\udfa8 Generate editable graphics and lifestyle creatives that match your brand\n\u270d\ufe0f\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Write compelling copy and calls-to-action\n\ud83d\udd0d\ud83d\udca5 Produce A/B test variations (colors, copy, backgrounds, sizes, languages, audiences)\n\ud83c\udf0d\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Translate your ads for global reach\n\nJust enter a prompt, upload a product image or link \u2014 and in under a minute \u23f1\ufe0f, you get everything you need.\nNo hassle.

Supporting this, a three-line paragraph **description** offers value propositions. At the bottom, a standout yellow text element **tagline** announces the launch, followed by a red rectangular call-to-action button **cta_button** with bold white **cta_text** inside.\n\nThe overall composition combines modern typography with strategic hierarchy and spacing, guided by a clean, tech-inspired aesthetic.\n\n**Color Palette:**\n- Deep Plum: `#372b48`\n- Royal Violet: `#6729f3`\n- Bright Yellow: `#ffc93f`\n- Coral Red: `#de525a`\n- Light Gray: `#ffffffb3`\n- White: `#ffffff`\n",
    "product_color": "  \nThe product image features a pastel green maternity gown that exudes calmness, comfort, and softness. The primary color is a soft mint green (#B9E6A6), providing a soothing and refreshing visual tone. Embroidered floral accents in white (#FFFFFF) and pale pink (#FADADD) add a gentle decorative touch, enhancing femininity and elegance without overpowering the main color. These colors blend harmoniously, maintaining a uniform pastel aesthetic while ensuring the embroidery is subtly highlighted. Complementary skin tones in warm medium brown (#A56C43) and the neutral tan of the sandals (#CBA67D) add natural grounding to the image. This light, nature-inspired palette can be used in advertisement banners to evoke tranquility and care.  \n"
