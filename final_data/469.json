The background utilizes a dark blue gradient with a subtle grid pattern and circular glow accents, creating a technical and immersive feel. At the center, there's a high-resolution image of the controller (`product_image`), highlighted by a glowing backdrop. Above the image, a bold headline (`heading`) and a sleeker subheading (`subheading`) introduce the product. Below the image, key product features are listed in a smaller font (`description`). At the bottom, a large price highlight (`price`) draws attention, accompanied by a call-to-action button composed of a rectangle (`cta_background`) and motivating text (`cta`).\n\n**Color Palette:**\n- Midnight Blue: `#1E232E`\n- Graphite Gray: `#323744`\n- Metallic Silver: `#BFC2C9`\n- Gold Beige: `#C0A87F`\n- Soft White: `#FFFFFF`\n",
    "product_color": "\nThe product image shows a stylish Xbox controller with a futuristic transparent design. Its primary color palette includes silver-gray (#C0C0C0), white (#FFFFFF), and metallic gold (#CFB53B). The gray and white tones blend seamlessly, offering a sleek, high-tech look, with the transparency allowing internal elements to subtly show through, adding visual depth. The metallic gold D-pad stands out as the focal highlight, emphasizing luxury and performance. These colors create a balanced contrast with elegance and sophistication. For an advertisement banner, a palette featuring #C0C0C0, #FFFFFF, #CFB53B, #A9A9A9 (dark gray), and #E0E0E0 (light silver) would effectively echo the product\u2019s premium feel.\n"
