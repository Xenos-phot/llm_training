A central product image (`product_image`) of a white and red glove is prominently displayed, bridging the heading and pricing info. The heading (`heading`) appears bold in uppercase red with strong impact, while a smaller subheading (`subheading`) in dark gray supports it. Price (`price`) is emphasized in large white typography over a bold red wave-patterned background. A dark gray call-to-action box (`cta_background`) with white text (`cta`) invites purchase. Decorative zigzag accents complete the dynamic aesthetic.\n\n**Color Palette**:\n- #F5F5F5 (Light Gray Background)\n- #E63946 (Red Accents and Wave)\n- #C1121F (Deep Red)\n- #FFFFFF (White Text and Product)\n- #333333 (Dark Gray Text and CTA Button)\n",
    "product_color": "\nThe product image showcases a white Adidas glove with red accents, creating a bold yet minimalistic color palette. The base color is a clean, matte white (#F3F4F6), which dominates the design and allows the red elements to stand out. Rich crimson red (#B22222) details such as the logo, perforation lining, and inner thumb contrast sharply with the white, grabbing attention while maintaining balance. Subtle hints of metallic grey (#D3D3D3) in the strap area add depth without overwhelming the design. These colors blend smoothly, with the white offering a neutral background that highlights the dynamic red tones effectively for advertisement use.\n"
