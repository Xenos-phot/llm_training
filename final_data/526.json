The background features a soft diagonal cream gradient with stylized dash lines and overlapping translucent geometric elements for depth. A central shoe image (`product_image`) dominates the composition, slanted dynamically over a warm orange abstract shape that creates motion. The main title (`heading`) is styled in a bold, dark gray font at the top, supplemented by a red-orange tagline (`tagline`) just below it to emphasize performance. A compact feature description (`description`) sits under the product, followed by a brightly colored price (`price`) in large font. A rounded orange call-to-action button (`cta_button`) with \"SHOP NOW\" (`cta`) text completes the layout. Fonts are bold, modern, and sans-serif throughout.\n\n**Color Palette:**\n- Warm Cream: `#f7f5f0`, `#f0e9e1`\n- Burnt Orange: `#FF6347`, `#ff6b4a`\n- Lemon Yellow: `#ffb347`\n- Charcoal Gray: `#333333`\n- White: `#ffffff`\n",
    "product_color": "\nThe product image features a dynamic and modern color palette suitable for an energetic advertisement banner. Dominated by neutral beige (#E8E2D2) on the upper mesh, the shoe highlights gradient accents ranging from vivid orange (#FF5722) to warm yellow (#FFC107), symbolizing speed and motion. The black stripes (#212121) introduce contrast and brand identity, while touches of red (#EF4444) on the tongue and lace area add vibrancy. The white and gray sole (#F5F5F5 and #9E9E9E) grounds the design. These colors are smoothly blended to convey a sense of flow while contrasted smartly to ensure brand visibility and energetic appeal.\n"
