At the core is a high-quality over-ear headphones image (\"product_image\") positioned centrally, which is the main visual focus. The headline (\"heading\") is large, bold, and uses a futuristic font in white, conveying a strong tech vibe. Below it, the subheading (\"subheading\") in vivid pink highlights the premium wireless feature of the product. A feature list (\"tagline\") consisting of three key product attributes is spread widely along the horizontal axis in white. The price (\"price\") is prominently displayed in bright pink below the features. At the bottom, a purple button (\"cta_background\") contains a contrasting white call-to-action (\"cta\") encouraging users to shop. The layout is clean, symmetrical, and visually striking.\n\n**Color Palette:**\n- Background: #121212 (Dark Charcoal)\n- Highlight Pink: #E040FB (Vibrant Pink)\n- Accent Purple: #9C27B0 (Deep Purple)\n- Circle Overlay 1: #6A1B9A at 30% opacity\n- Circle Overlay 2: #E040FB at 15% opacity\n- Circle Overlay 3: #9C27B0 at 20% opacity\n- Text White: #FFFFFF\n",
    "product_color": "\nThe product image showcases sleek black over-ear headphones accented with a vibrant LED ring. The dominant color is matte black (#1C1C1C), which provides a modern and premium feel. Metallic gray (#5F5F5F) is used subtly along the edges, enhancing depth and dimension. A glowing RGB LED light encircles the earcups, transitioning smoothly through bright magenta (#FF2D95), neon pink (#FF4DDE), and vivid red (#FF4747), offering an eye-catching visual contrast that promotes a high-tech look. These colors blend seamlessly against the dark base, giving prominence to the light ring while maintaining harmony. Together, they suggest innovation and bold style in the design.\n"
