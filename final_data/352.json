The subheading (\"subheading\") and feature list (\"description\") add clarity in a bold and light lavender tone. A bold white price (\"price\") grabs attention, and a rounded lavender button with dark purple call-to-action (\"cta\") anchors the layout.\n\n**Color Palette:**\n- Deep Purple: #6A0DAD\n- Violet: #8A2BE2\n- Lavender: #E6E6FA\n- Light Purple: #D8BFD8\n- White: #FFFFFF\n",

The primary color palette includes a pastel lavender (#D1B2FF) for the glossy ear cups, a medium orchid tone (#A083C9) for the headband, and a deeper plum (#5E4B8B) for the inner padding. These hues blend smoothly through a gradient finish that emphasizes form and curvature while maintaining a minimalist look. Metallic buttons add contrast with a subtle silver (#E0E0E0) sheen. This cohesive and harmonious palette can be used in branding to evoke sophistication, tranquility, and innovation, ideal for an advertisement targeting premium tech users.\n"
