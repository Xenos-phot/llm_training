The canvas is vertically divided into two toned neutral backgrounds, with the left half in a soft off-white and the right in a light beige. A product image is placed on the right-side, drawing primary attention. The left side contains layered text: a bold heading (`heading`) for the product name, a smaller subheading (`subheading`) that describes the product use, followed by a short bullet-point feature list (`description`). A large, stylized price (`price`) appears below. A rectangular button (`cta_background`) with centered call-to-action text (`cta`) encourages user engagement.\n\n**Color Palette:**\n- Off-white: `#F8F4EF`\n- Light Beige: `#EBE3D9`\n- Coffee Brown: `#5D4037`\n- Warm Tan: `#A67C52`\n- White (text on CTA): `#FFFFFF`\n",
    "product_color": "\nThe product image showcases a modern, convertible coffee table with a minimalist color palette. The primary colors include crisp white (#FFFFFF) for the base, and a rich walnut brown (#6E4B33) for the tabletop. These two tones contrast sharply yet harmoniously, emphasizing the functional dual-layer design. Subtle accents include muted beige (#D3BFA6) and greige (#C1B6AC) in the decorative boxes, and soft sage green (#8E9984) seen in the potted plant and round d\u00e9cor item. These earthy tones blend seamlessly with the white foundation, creating a clean and airy aesthetic that's visually appealing. Ideal for a clean, professional banner design.\n"
