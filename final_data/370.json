Below is a bold price tag (\"price\") and a rounded rectangular call-to-action button (\"cta\") with a subtle contrasting fill and strong label. The right side contains a cutout product image (\"product_image\") slightly overlapping two quadrants for visual depth. The banner uses a clean, modular structure suitable for e-commerce apparel promotions.\n\n**Color Palette:**\n- Navy Blue: #1A365D  \n- Royal Blue: #2B4B81  \n- Steel Blue: #3D6098  \n- Light Gray Blue: #E8EFF9  \n- White: #FFFFFF  \n- Accent Lines: #5773A3 (semi-transparent diagonal elements)\n",
    "product_color": "\nThe product image showcases a pair of classic blue jeans styled with a white top and black ballet flats. The dominant color is a rich denim blue (#2F4F88), which blends lighter blue highlights (#5A7BB0) and subtle indigo shadows (#1F3B63) to create depth and texture. The white top (#FFFFFF) enhances contrast, drawing attention to the jeans. The black flats (#1A1A1A) ground the overall look. For an advertising banner, a complementary palette of soft neutrals (e.g., beige #F5F5DC) and accent blues can maintain the focus on the product while keeping the composition elegant and contemporary.\n"
