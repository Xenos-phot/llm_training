Above this, there are two text layers: `heading` displaying the main brand name in large bold red typography, and `subheading` below in a darker gray font introducing the product type. A red circular price tag (`price_background`) overlaps the product image on the right, with the pricing text inside (`price`) in bold white. Below, three key features of the product are mentioned (`description`) in small black text with bullet points. At the bottom center, a red call-to-action button (`cta_background`) with white text (`cta`) encourages user interaction. The background (`background`) is subtly styled in soft gradients with translucent decorative shapes and diagonal lines adding depth and balance.\n\n**Color Palette:**\n- Red: #D50032\n- Dark Red: #9C0022\n- White: #FFFFFF\n- Soft Gray Gradient: #F8F8F8 \u2192 #F0F0F0\n- Charcoal Gray (text): #333333\n",
    "product_color": "\nThe product image showcases a sleek Adidas glove, primarily in a clean, minimalist white (#F4F4F4) base. The white serves as a neutral background that allows the bold, deep red (#B21E1E) accents, including the Adidas logo, mesh perforations, and inner lining, to stand out sharply. A slightly off-white or light gray (#D9D9D9) is used in the stitching and trim, blending subtly with the dominant shade while offering visual depth. The bold red is strategically used to highlight the brand and add sporty energy. This color palette is ideal for an advertisement banner, evoking precision, passion, and performance through high contrast and sleek design.\n"
