The layout centers around a high-resolution product image (`product_image`), flanked by bold, futuristic header text (`heading`) and a tagline (`tagline`) in a techno-inspired font. Pricing is emphasized with a large, white contrasting text (`price`) toward the lower central area. A rounded rectangle CTA button (`cta_button`) contains the text `cta`, placed prominently to guide the user toward purchase.

The watch face integrates dark charcoal (#1C1E1B) and a luminous neon yellow-green (#D1F226), which provides a vibrant contrast and draws attention to the display. Small accent stitches in bright orange (#FF7F32) and sky blue (#71C5E8) add dynamic energy and visual interest. Together, these colors are blended for harmony, while also being strategically highlighted through contrast, making the design both bold and modern.  \n"
