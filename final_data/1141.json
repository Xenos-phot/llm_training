Below it, the model and product type are introduced in clean white font (`heading`). Key product highlights are listed in a bullet format (`features`) in the left-center. The price is emphasized in large golden text (`price`) followed by a bold call-to-action button (`cta_button` and `cta`) inviting users to shop. The product image (`product_image`) is prominently placed on the right, creating balance in the composition.\n\n**Color Palette:**\n- Background Black: #1A1A1A\n- Panel Gray: #252525\n- Accent Gold: #D4AF37\n- Text White: #FFFFFF\n- CTA Text Black: #000000\n",

Matte Black (#1B1B1B) dominates the structure, giving it a bold, high-end look. The ear cup texture includes a slightly lighter Charcoal Black (#2E2E2E), adding tactile depth. The white Marshall logo (#FFFFFF) stands out sharply against the black, ensuring brand visibility. A matte Gold (#D4AF37) metal accent adds a premium, classic rock vibe. These colors blend seamlessly while each element is distinctly visible, creating an ideal palette for a luxurious, powerful, and modern advertisement banner.  \n"
