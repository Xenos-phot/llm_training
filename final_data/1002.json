The background uses layered rectangles and soft gradient overlays in dark shades of gray and black, with semi-transparent red accent circles to add depth and visual interest. The \"heading\" text is bold and prominently placed at the top left in white, emphasizing the brand and model. Just below, the \"tagline\" text in red reinforces the promotional message. A list of features is clearly presented using bullet points under the \"description\" text layer. The pricing, shown using the \"price\" text layer, stands out in large white font. A vibrant red rectangular button labeled via \"cta\" text invites action, placed on top of the \"cta_background\" shape. The \"product_image\" displays a high-resolution camera render positioned to the right, balancing the overall layout visually.\n\n**Color Palette:**\n- Jet Black (#1A1A1A)\n- Charcoal Gray (#232323)\n- Crimson Red (#FF3B30)\n- Soft White (#FFFFFF)\n- Transparent Red (#FF0000 with opacity 0.15)\n",
    "product_color": "  \nThe product image of the Fujifilm X-T10 camera uses a sleek and professional color palette centered around deep black (#0D0D0D) for the camera body, contrasted with metallic grey (#4F4F4F) in the lens rings. White (#FFFFFF) is used for the Fujifilm and XT-10 branding and camera control markings, providing sharp readability. Highlights are added through reflective lens glass featuring subtle green-yellow hues (#B3BF56, #A0C49D) that add realism and depth. The overall blend creates a high-end, premium look. For an advertisement banner, pairing black and white with accent colors like metallic grey and soft green will reinforce the camera\u2019s modern and sophisticated appeal.  \n"
