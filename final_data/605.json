After each wash cycle finishes, a Dry mode provides an extra 60 minutes of drying and offers 72-hour ventilated storage to prevent odors and keep your dishes clean. UP TO 18-HOUR DELAYED START: HAVA Portable Dishwasher can finish the wash program according to your schedule. A delay of up to 18 hours is available with this new model, so you can be assured of having clean dishes at the desired time.
