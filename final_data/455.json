The centerpiece is a high-resolution product image (`product_image`) of a transparent game controller, surrounded by concentric circular accents in dotted and solid outlines that suggest advanced technology. The `price` layer is placed prominently over a highlighted circular background to capture attention. Supporting information in the `description` layer outlines major features. A call-to-action button (`cta_button`) with clearly legible, contrasting text (`cta`) encourages interaction. \n\n**Color Palette**:\n- Midnight Blue: `#1E1E2F` (Background)\n- Lavender Blue: `#A6B3E2` (Accent Lines and Button)\n- White: `#FFFFFF` (Text and Highlights)\n- Slate Blue: `#3D4466` (Gradient Element)\n- Very Light Blue: `#8A9AD1` (Gradient and Details)\n",
