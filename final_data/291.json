    "product_color": "\nThe product image features a sleek and minimalist headphone design dominated by a soft, creamy beige tone. The primary color is an elegant ivory (#F4F1E9), which lends it a premium and modern feel. Subtle shadows and highlights in slightly deeper taupe (#E3DDCF) and pale sand (#F1ECE4) create a gentle depth and 3D look, while a soft gray (#C9C4BA) in the ear mesh provides delicate contrast. These smooth transitions allow for a cohesive visual flow with no harsh breaks. For an advertisement banner, a palette of warm neutrals ensures the product's sophistication and calm appeal is emphasized while remaining clean and refined.\n"
