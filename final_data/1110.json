Below it, a paragraph (\"description\") outlines the key product features in a neatly formatted list. The pricing section (\"price\") is highlighted near the bottom left. A call-to-action button with accompanying text (\"cta_background\" and \"cta\") provides immediate shopping functionality.\n\n**Color Palette:**\n- Cream (#F5F1ED)\n- White (#FFFFFF)\n- Rich Brown (#8B5A2B)\n- Medium Brown (#7D4A29)\n- Light Brown (#A47551)\n- Deep Tan (#5E3A24)\n", "product_color": "\nThe product features a warm, earthy color palette that emphasizes neutrality with a stylish twist.

This is contrasted by rich coffee brown (#6E4B3A) used for the laces, eyelets, branding outline, and the gum sole, adding depth and grounding the design. Accents of bright white (#FFFFFF) in the side logo create a visual highlight, pulling focus and contrasting well against the brown. These tones are subtly blended to maintain a harmonious look while strategically placed to emphasize key features.\n"}
