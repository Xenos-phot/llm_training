This formula has silica, which immediately absorbs excess oil and diffuses light, leaving a natural matte finish on your face or bald head. REDUCES ACNE, BLACKHEADS, AND LARGE PORES \u2014 Sweet orange peel extract unclogs skin, leaving pores free of the gunk that causes blackheads and breakouts. Pores shrink to normal size and are less visible. Silica also helps remove toxins. HYDRATES WITHOUT HEAVINESS \u2014 Citronella extract softens and glycerin locks in moisture, leaving skin hydrated without being greasy or heavy. Skin becomes balanced; especially good for combination skin where you have oily and dry patches. An outstanding makeup primer. FREE OF ALL THE BAD STUFF \u2014 The last thing your skin needs is gunk. That\u2019s why Instant Fix Oil Control is free of parabens, phthalates, GMOs, DEA, and triclosan. It\u2019s also allergy and dermatologist tested, and made cruelty free in the USA. FAVORITE WITH GROOMING EXPERTS\u2014 Anthony brand men\u2019s grooming products have been featured (and won awards) in top publications, including Men\u2019s Health, New York Times, Forbes, GQ, and Esquire.

The primary title (`heading`) is large and white, drawing attention to the main selling point, while the supporting subtitle (`subheading`) uses a vibrant orange to highlight product benefits. A concise bulleted list (`description`) outlines notable features in white for easy readability. The product image (`product_image`) is prominently placed on the right side to maintain visual balance. The price (`price`) is displayed boldly to attract conversions, followed by a noticeable call-to-action (`cta`, `cta_background`) in an orange rounded button.\n\n**Color Palette:**\n- Background Black: `#212121`\n- Dark Grey Blocks: `#1A1A1A`, `#262626`, `#333333`\n- Headline White: `#FFFFFF`\n- Accent Orange: `#D65A31`\n- Light Grey Detail Fonts: `#444444`\n\n",

Dominated by matte black (#1A1A1A) and light grey (#E6E6E6), the packaging creates a strong contrast that draws immediate attention. White (#FFFFFF) is used for key information, maintaining readability. Accents of vibrant red (#D1342C) strategically highlight words like \u201cObjective\u201d and \u201cStrategy,\u201d adding urgency and directing focus. A softer charcoal gray (#4D4D4D) supports secondary information. The brand name \u201cAnthony\u201d blends white and red, standing out against black and reinforcing brand identity. These tones blend seamlessly while contrasting enough to remain visually distinct and engaging.  \n"
