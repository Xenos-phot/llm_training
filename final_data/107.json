The layout includes a large, eye-catching product image on the right side. The text is divided into five primary layers: two bold headings (`heading_1`, `heading_2`) in white, a subheading (`subheading`) in golden yellow, a checklist-style features list (`description`) in white, and a prominent price tag (`price`) in white just above a call-to-action button (`cta_background`, `cta`) in golden yellow and blue respectively. The overall style is clean and modern, leveraging contrast and visual hierarchy.\n\n**Color Palette:**\n- Blue Gradient: `#005DA8` to `#0079C1`\n- Accent Yellow: `#F8D568`\n- White: `#FFFFFF`\n- Light Gradient Blue: `#E6F2F9`\n- CTA Text Blue: `#005DA8`\n",

Key colors include **white (#FFFFFF)** as the dominant background for a clean and hygienic look, and **deep blue (#003399)** used for the Dove logo and text to signify reliability and depth. **Gold/yellow (#D6A73F)** adds a touch of sophistication and highlights the \"Micro Moisture Serum\" and \"Clinically Proven\" sections. The **gray (#696969)** pump adds neutrality and balances the design. Soft gradients of **light blue (#A7D3F4)** in the splash element evoke freshness and moisture. All colors are smoothly integrated, with contrasting hues used for emphasis."
