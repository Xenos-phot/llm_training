The background is divided into two soft pink tones, the left side being more saturated and the right side in a muted blush, separated by a vertical dashed line. A dot pattern adds texture behind the text, and minimalist abstract line shapes are placed on the right for visual balance. The left section features multiple text layers including a bold heading (`heading`), a pink tagline (`tagline`), a feature description list (`description`), a large price (`price`), and a rounded call-to-action button comprised of a shape (`cta_background`) and centered text (`cta`). A supporting statement (`subheading`) sits beneath the button. The right side presents a high-resolution image of the product (`product_image`). The composition is visually balanced with informative and commercial elements clearly segmented.\n\n**Color Palette:**\n- Soft Blush (#FFF5F7)\n- Pastel Pink (#FFC0CB)\n- Highlight Pink (#FF6B8E)\n- Light Rose (#FFB6C1)\n- Accent Pink (#FF8AA6)\n- Dark Charcoal (#333333)\n- Medium Gray (#555555)\n- Light Gray (#777777)\n- White (#FFFFFF)\n", "product_color": "\nThe product image presents a soft, pastel aesthetic characterized by a muted blush pink canvas material, which dominates the visual space and creates a calm, feminine appeal. The primary color is a light pink (#F4AEBB), subtly blended with lighter shades such as baby pink (#FAD4D8) and hints of warm neutral tones like pale peach (#F9CFCF). The consistent fabric texture gives depth and uniformity, while shadows along the pockets and edges add dimension without harsh contrast. Metal hardware in a subtle silver (#B0B0B0) offers a balancing cool tone. This color palette suits clean, modern ad banners with a gentle, inviting feel.\n"}
