The price (text layer `price`) stands out prominently in bold font, followed by a pill-shaped call-to-action button (rect `cta_button` with text `cta`) labeled for user engagement. On the right, a high-quality product image (`product_image`) showcases the table. Background elements and decorative shapes give the banner a balanced and sophisticated appearance.\n\n**Color Palette:**\n- Deep Mocha Brown: `#735D54`\n- Soft Beige: `#F5F0EB`\n- White: `#FFFFFF`\n- Blush Taupe: `#D7C0B0`\n- Light Taupe Stroke: `#B7A99C`\n",

The colors are well-blended to balance light and dark tones, and the brown top acts as a visual anchor. For an ad banner, a palette of white, walnut brown, muted green, and light gray will emphasize simplicity and elegance.\n"
