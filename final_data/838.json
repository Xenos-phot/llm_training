A **metallic silver** accent (#D6D6D6) on the wrist area introduces a sleek, premium feel. These colors are blended seamlessly, with white highlighting the red branding and perforations, ensuring visual clarity. For an advertisement banner, a balance of red and white, with touches of silver for detailing, would effectively reflect the product's style and dynamism.  \n"
