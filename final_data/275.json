modes for your various dishwashing needs. After each wash cycle finishes, a Dry mode provides an extra 60 minutes of drying and offers 72-hour ventilated storage to prevent odors and keep your dishes clean. UP TO 18-HOUR DELAYED START: HAVA Portable Dishwasher can finish the wash program according to your schedule. A delay of up to 18 hours is available with this new model, so you can be assured of having clean dishes at the desired time. You may also use this feature to run the machine during a non-peak time for a lower electricity bill. SELF-CLEAN & CHILD LOCK FUNCTION: The HAVA Mini Dishwasher features a Self-Clean program for thorough cleaning from the inside out, ensuring consistent washing performance. It also includes a child lock function to prevent misoperation. NO INSTALLATION NEEDED: Simply add water to the built-in 5L water tank for your washing task, so you can put the dishwasher in any suitable place without connecting to tap water. Also, you can connect the water inlet to a faucet using the included hose (adapter included). A compact design makes it perfect for small-sized houses, apartments, dorms, boats, and campers/RVs. LARGE CAPACITY & SAVES ENERGY: HAVA Counter Top Dishwasher can hold up to 4 full-place settings and fit up to 11 dishes loaded at an angle.
