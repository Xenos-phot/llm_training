The top-left section includes a light peach (#F8B195) fill, while the bottom-right section uses a deep slate blue (#355C7D). Decorative semi-transparent geometric elements (lines and circles) accent the layout with a playful touch. The primary headline (`heading`), subheadline (`subheading`), and price (`price`) are prominently set in large, bold white text, creating strong visual hierarchy. A product feature list (`description`) is placed below the subhead in soft peach for a subtle yet informative callout. The central product image (`product_image`) is positioned flat and centered. A brightly colored call-to-action button (`cta_background`, `cta`) in coral orange (#FF7F50) invites interaction. The composition balances visual clarity and commercial appeal.\n\n**Color Palette**:  \n- Peach: #F8B195  \n- Slate Blue: #355C7D  \n- White: #FFFFFF  \n- Coral Orange: #FF7F50  \n",
    "product_color": "  \nThe product image showcases a sleek and modern Crockpot with a minimalistic, professional color palette. Dominated by a cool, matte charcoal gray body (#6E6E6E), the product uses soft gradients to provide depth and soft contrast. The lid and accent parts incorporate a subtle metallic silver-gray (#D3D3D3), while the control panel features a creamy off-white background (#F1F1F1) that highlights the text and buttons. The text and interface buttons use muted taupe (#A9A8A8) and darker gray (#4A4A4A) to maintain slick readability. This palette blends cool neutrals with subtle warmth, perfect for banner backgrounds, lifestyle imagery, or call-to-action highlights in advertisements.  \n"
