The composition centers around a prominent product image (\"product_image\") on the right side, giving visual focus to the camera. To the left, a large uppercase title (\"heading\") in white paired with a striking red subheading (\"subheading\") creates a strong hierarchy. Beneath, a bullet-point list (\"description\") highlights product features in a clean, readable format. A product name (\"product_name\") and urgency tagline (\"tagline\") accentuate the urgency, followed by a standout price display (\"price\") and a red call-to-action button (\"cta\") underlined by a rounded rectangle (\"cta_background\"). The dark background features subtle red circular and line motifs for visual depth and contrast.\n\n**Color Palette:**\n- Background: #1A1A1A, #121212, #232323 (dark grayscale tones)\n- Primary Text: #FFFFFF (white)\n- Accent/Highlight: #CF1919 (vibrant red)\n",
    "product_color": "\nThe product image features a Fujifilm X-T10 camera predominantly in a matte black body, giving it a sleek and professional look. The primary color is deep black (#0D0D0D), with subtle highlights of metallic grey (#5A5A5A) along the lens housing and dials, creating a sophisticated contrast. White text (#FFFFFF) is used dynamically on the body for branding and technical details, offering clean visibility. Small accents of red (#FF3224) and orange (#FFA500) near the lens provide vibrant focal pops. The color blending between textures is smooth but intentional, enhancing structure while maintaining high visual clarity and offering an ideal dark-modern palette for promotional use.\n"
