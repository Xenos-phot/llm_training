It is split into two sections: the left side highlights information, while the right side features a large product image identified by the `product_image` layer. The left section includes a bold title with three lines identified by the `heading` layer, followed by a subheadline (`subheading`) that introduces the product name. Below that is a feature list (`description`) displaying key benefits. A prominent price tag (`price`) in bold font draws attention, paired with a call-to-action button composed of a colored rectangle (`cta_background`) and centered text (`cta`). The background features abstract shapes and smooth gradients that complement the product theme.\n\n**Color Palette:**\n- Dark Slate: `#1E2E33`\n- Teal Gray: `#2A4044`\n- Deep Sage: `#4B6D63`\n- Muted Aqua: `#5A8277`\n- Soft Mint: `#7FBCAB`\n- Pale Turquoise: `#A0D6C8`\n- White: `#FFFFFF`\n",
    "product_color": "\nThe product image showcases over-ear headphones predominantly in a sleek, matte forest green color (#3C5A50). This primary color gives a sophisticated and modern appeal, while subtle darker shading along the curves and joints provides depth and visual interest. Highlights and contours creatively use tonal variations of the same green palette, like a muted olive green (#4B6B60) and deep pine green (#2E453D), to accentuate texture and form. These understated yet rich tones harmonize seamlessly, allowing the logo in a slightly brighter sage green (#6E8E81) to stand out. For an advertisement banner, a complementary palette with neutral greys and soft whites will maintain focus on the product.\n"
