The layout is divided into a two-tone background with a light gray upper section and dark gray lower section, creating strong visual contrast. The banner features a bold, all-caps primary heading (`heading`) and a clean, sans-serif subheading (`subheading`) to communicate the product's category or slogan. A bulleted list (`description`) outlines product features in a lighter font style. Bottom left, a large, prominent price (`price`) in white grabs attention over a dark background. Below it, a vibrant red call-to-action button (`cta_button`) with white text (`cta`) encourages user interaction. A realistic product image (`product_image`) is centrally positioned and overlapped by a background panel to ground it visually. Abstract circular and curved shapes are subtly integrated into the background for a stylish and contemporary look.\n\n**Color Palette**:\n- Light Gray: `#E8E8E8`\n- Charcoal Dark Gray: `#404040`\n- Medium Gray: `#686868`\n- Soft Gray Highlight: `#777777`\n- Accent Red: `#D32F2F`\n- White: `#FFFFFF`\n- Text Dark Gray: `#333333`\n- Text Mid Gray: `#666666`\n", "product_color": "\nThe product image features a modern Crockpot with a sleek and minimalist design, predominantly in shades of gray. The main body is a matte charcoal gray (#666666), which creates a strong and neutral base. This is smoothly blended with a slightly lighter gray (#999999) used for the control panel housing, creating dimension while maintaining cohesion. The white LED display area (#F6F6F6) and logo add contrast and accentuate the functionality, making these elements stand out. Subtle shadows and highlights give a metallic feel without overpowering the aesthetic. Suitable banner colors include charcoal gray, light gray, soft white, and a muted silver (#CCCCCC).\n"}
