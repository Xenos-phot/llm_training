The headline layer (`headline`) uses a futuristic stencil font in a bold lavender hue, drawing immediate attention. Below it, the subheading (`subheading`) in white introduces the platform's core promise in all caps. A key features section (`description`) with bullet points outlines the service's benefits in a clean blue shade on the left side, adding informative value. A pricing highlight (`price`) in large, bold typography captures consumer interest. A bold call-to-action button (`cta_button` and `cta`) in vibrant blue encourages user interaction. An image of an appliance (`product_image`) is placed to the right, standing out sharply against the stylized background. The `tagline` rests subtly below the button, adding a final branded message.\n\n**Color Palette:**\n- Midnight Blue: #080F34\n- Royal Indigo: #1B2559\n- Slate Blue: #3B4DBA\n- Lavender Blue: #7A8AF0\n- Periwinkle: #5D6EE8\n- Cyan White: #E0FFFF\n- Pure White: #FFFFFF\n", "product_color": "  \nThe product image features a sleek, modern washer and dryer set characterized by a clean monochrome palette.
